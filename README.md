# cube game

- **Rigid body physics:** Linear and angular movement done
- **Collisions:** SAT for rotated boxes
- **Game logic:** Player generates magnetic force and (TODO:) dashes, damage with collision force
- **UI:** Game State, may use Raygui, prepare for connection
- **Connection:** UDP hole punching if no public ip provided, still needs a vps. Listen server (client just sends input).
